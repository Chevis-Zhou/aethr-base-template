/**
 * Verifying the suite itself, `qa-specification.md` §10. An unverified QA suite is worse
 * than no suite — it produces a green verdict with no reason to trust it.
 *
 * - Negative control: `fixtures/negative-control.json`, crafted to trip a blocker in every
 *   content-sanity check the harness can drive from spec data alone (§5.1's checks 2/3/4/5/6/7
 *   and §5.1 check 8's h1 count). Must PARK.
 * - Positive control: `fixtures/maxematics-v1.json` — the real ANALYSIS output for the
 *   Maxematics replay (`_replay-maxematics/analysis/2026-09-06T22-44-02.255Z/spec-approved.json`,
 *   the Phase 5 acceptance run), with the two page-level REVIEW-flagged blanks
 *   (`client.description`, `pages[0].description`) filled the way a human would at REVIEW
 *   before BUILD ever runs. Section props the copy floor blanked are left blank on purpose —
 *   007 ruled REVIEW read-only for copy, and the flags sheet marks only the page-level
 *   fields as needing a human. Must PASS clean.
 *
 *   **Replaced the 2026-09-05 fixture deliberately.** That one passed only because none of
 *   its copy contained an apostrophe, which is the single character that broke check 1 (see
 *   `htmlToText`). A positive control that cannot fail on the commonest punctuation mark in
 *   English prose is not exercising the check it is supposed to protect. This spec carries
 *   "USF's" and "Founder & tutor", so it can.
 *
 * - Entity guard: `htmlToText` is also checked directly against a table of escapes, because
 *   a fixture only covers the characters its client happened to write. The table covers the
 *   ones React's SSR emits, in both hex and decimal form.
 *
 * Deliberately not forced by either fixture: the accessibility floor (Lighthouse/axe) and
 * the layout assertions. Both operate on the closed, shared component palette rather than
 * on spec content — §4's own reasoning ("an accessibility defect in it is a template
 * regression to be found once") is exactly why spec data can't script one. This harness
 * verifies those two stages run clean on both controls, not that they can be tripped by data.
