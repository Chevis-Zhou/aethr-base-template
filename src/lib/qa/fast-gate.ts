/**
 * The fast gate — `qa-specification.md` §8's first row: §5.1's eight checks (the link
 * check is one of them) against an already-built `out/`. No opt-out, on every deploy
 * including a client self-edit publish.
 *
 * Why this is not `runFullSuite({ check: "content" })`: that orchestrator assembles and
 * builds first, because it is the pipeline's oracle over a spec. The gate runs *after* the
 * build, on the artifact about to be uploaded — ticket 012 §4 puts it pre-upload precisely
 * so a client edit that breaks the site never reaches a hostname. It also drops Lighthouse
 * and the four-width layout pass, which are the full suite's, and keeps the asset check
 * because a client's own upload is the one input that can arrive unoptimised.
 *
 * The verdict is intentionally binary here. `verdictOf`'s three-way PARKED/STAGED/PASS is
 * the pipeline's instrument; §4.3 rules that a self-edit failure blocks in the editor
 * instead of parking the client, because the person who caused it is sitting in the editor.
